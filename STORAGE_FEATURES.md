# Enhanced Storage Management Feature

## Overview
The storage management feature has been expanded from cookie-only to comprehensive web storage management, including:
- **Cookies** - HTTP cookies for the current domain
- **localStorage** - Persistent client-side storage
- **sessionStorage** - Session-specific client-side storage

## Features Implemented

### 1. Comprehensive Storage Export
- **Export All Storage**: One-click export of all storage types to a single JSON file
- **Real-time Access**: Uses Chrome's scripting API to read localStorage/sessionStorage directly from the page
- **Metadata Included**: Domain, URL, timestamp, and categorized storage data
- **Smart Filename**: `storage_domain.com_15items_2025-01-17.json`

### 2. Intelligent Storage Import
- **Backward Compatibility**: Automatically detects and converts legacy cookie-only files
- **Comprehensive Restore**: Imports all storage types back to the website
- **Validation**: Checks file format and ensures data integrity
- **Page Injection**: Uses content script injection to restore localStorage/sessionStorage

### 3. Complete Storage Clearing
- **All-in-one Clear**: Removes cookies, localStorage, and sessionStorage in one action
- **User Confirmation**: Clear confirmation dialog showing exactly what will be cleared
- **Real-time Feedback**: Shows counts of items cleared by category

### 4. Detailed Storage Information
- **Live Counts**: Real-time display of storage items by category
- **Domain-specific**: Shows storage for the current website only
- **Breakdown Display**: "15 items for domain.com" with "5 cookies â€¢ 8 localStorage â€¢ 2 sessionStorage"

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture Changes
- **StorageManager Class**: Replaces CookieManager with expanded functionality
- **Chrome Scripting API**: Used to access localStorage/sessionStorage from content scripts
- **Backward Compatibility**: Legacy cookie-only functions still work seamlessly
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with comprehensive interfaces

### New Interfaces
```typescript
interface StorageExport {
  domain: string;
  url: string;
  timestamp: number;
  cookies: CookieData[];
  localStorage: LocalStorageData;
  sessionStorage: LocalStorageData;
}

interface LocalStorageData {
  [key: string]: string;
}
```

### Chrome API Integration
- **chrome.cookies**: For cookie management (existing)
- **chrome.scripting**: For localStorage/sessionStorage access (new)
- **Content Script Injection**: Functions injected into page context for storage access

## UI Improvements

### Modern Interface
- **Storage Section**: Renamed from "Cookie Management" to "Storage Management" 
- **Enhanced Display**: Shows total item count plus breakdown by storage type
- **Visual Feedback**: Loading states, success/error messages with detailed information
- **Improved Buttons**: "Export All Storage", "Import Storage", "Clear All Storage"

### User Experience
- **One-Click Operations**: Export/import/clear all storage types together
- **Smart File Handling**: Automatic detection of legacy vs. new format files  
- **Detailed Feedback**: Specific counts for each operation (e.g., "Imported 15 items: 5 cookies, 8 localStorage, 2 sessionStorage")
- **Confirmation Dialogs**: Clear warnings about what will be removed

## File Format

### New Storage Format
```json
{
  "domain": "example.com",
  "url": "https://example.com/",
  "timestamp": 1642435200000,
  "cookies": [
    {
      "name": "session_id",
      "value": "abc123",
      "domain": ".example.com",
      "path": "/",
      "secure": true,
      "httpOnly": true,
      "sameSite": "lax",
      "expirationDate": 1642521600
    }
  ],
  "localStorage": {
    "user_preferences": "{\"theme\":\"dark\"}",
    "last_visit": "2024-01-17"
  },
  "sessionStorage": {
    "temp_data": "temporary_value",
    "form_state": "{\"step\":2}"
  }
}
```

### Legacy Compatibility
- **Automatic Detection**: Old cookie-only files are automatically detected
- **Seamless Conversion**: Legacy files converted to new format during import
- **No Data Loss**: All existing cookie export files continue to work
